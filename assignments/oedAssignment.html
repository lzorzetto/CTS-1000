                <h2>Three Sources for Equality in the OED</h2>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    <strong>Quote 1 (1817)</strong><br>
                    “Ye are all equal; nature made ye so. Equality is your birth-right.”<br>

                    <br>Southey, Robert. “Wat Tyler : A Dramatic Poem in Three Acts.” <em>Internet Archive</em>, London: Printed for Sherwood,
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neely, and Jones, 1 Jan. 1970, <a href="https://archive.org/details/wattylerdramatic01sout/page/31/mode/1up">https://archive.org/details/wattylerdramatic01sout/page/31/mode/1up</a>

                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a web search, I found a scanned text of Robert Southey’s 1817 play, <em>Wat Tyler</em>, in the Internet Archive website. This 
                        play is based in England in 1381 and retells the story of Wat Tyler who was a leader in England’s first revolution, the Peasant’s Revolt 
                        (Basdeo). It is interesting to think that equality was a discussion point back then, just as it is now. This quote, found in act II page 
                        31,  has changed my perspective on equality since the characters describe it as something everyone is born with rather than something we 
                        must obtain. By this, I mean that we are all born with equality, but the society we are raised in can affect our view of the world, and 
                        certain societal privileges around us may lead us to forget that, and then we must relearn it. Additionally, the quote shows that the 
                        need for equality has been a struggle for centuries.<br>


                    <br><strong>Quote 2 (1867-70)</strong><br>
                    “Race equality in the North is pitted against race inequality in the South.”<br>

                    <br>Draper, John William. <em>History of the American Civil War</em>. Vol. 1, Harper, 1867. 

                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the University of Guelph Library website, I was able to find a copy of the <em>History of the American Civil War</em> v.1., by John 
                        Williams Draper. In chapter 27, page 460, Draper discusses racial inequality in Southern states in contrast to their equality in the 
                        Northern states during the American Civil War. The quote demonstrates my point from the previous quote, that the society which we grow up 
                        in can affect our equality values. For this instance, the laws and systems which the South was built on involved slavery and white 
                        supremacy, leading to equality being something people had to fight for. Whereas in the North, there was still racial inequality in other 
                        aspects, such as segregation and discrimination, however the North had started ending slavery before the Civil War (Thompson). This quote 
                        shows me that inequality presents itself in many different forms depending on the context, in this case a civil war for racial equality.<br>


                    <br><strong>Quote 3 (2019)</strong><br>
                    “Douglass reminds us that free speech is anchored in the inalienable rights of human freedom and equality, and not in a legal ruling.”<br>

                    <br>Baer, Ulrich. <em>What Snowflakes Get Right: Free Speech, Truth, and Equality on Campus</em>. Oxford
                        University Press, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2019. 

                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found U. Baer’s 2019, <em>What Snowflakes Get Right</em>, through the University of Guelph Library website. Baer discusses college 
                        campuses and their expression of free speech and human rights. This quote from chapter 3, page 76, explains that equality should be about 
                        treating people fairly in all aspects of life by our own will and not just by following laws and rules that tell us to do so. This quote 
                        affected my view of equality by making me think about how equality is an inherent value we all have, rather than something that should 
                        have to be enforced. Overall, I now think that equality is based on our daily actions towards other people instead of complying to legal 
                        requirements.<br>
