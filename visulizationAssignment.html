                <h2>Visualization Critique</h2>
                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New York Times visualization, “By midcentury, nine former Winter Olympics sites may not be reliably 
                    cold enough for the Games,” shows how climate change may affect winter Olympic sport in various past locations. A research group led 
                    by Daniel Scott, a Geography professor at the University of Waterloo created the predictions by collecting “climate data from previous 
                    Winter Games locations and applying climate-change models to predict future winter weather conditions” (Pierre-Louis and Popovich). 
                    The visualization is two horizontal bar graphs showing past data (1981-2010) and future predictions (2041-2070) of the reliability 
                    that the daily minimum temperature in February will be at or below freezing. This visualization uses data visualization conventions 
                    and two bar graphs to present a past data set and a future prediction of the connection between the environment and past winter 
                    Olympics sites.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spatio-temporal visualization (Meirelles 159-184) uses conventions such as two-dimensional 
                    viewpoints, clean layouts, and geometric shapes and lines, encouraging the public—likely those concerned with climate change and 
                    winter sports culture—to see it as factual (D'Ignazio and Klein). The dark orange bars contrast with the others highlighting 
                    significant change. Although the visualization enables easy comparison between past and future data using rectangular bar graphs, its 
                    flaws include lacking data sources on the graphic itself—these are instead placed within the article—and arranging entries by future 
                    reliability, which complicates comparing geographically proximate cities for regional trends. 
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bar chart clearly labels the metric: the chance that the daily minimum temperature in February 
                    is at or below freezing. However, it does not specify when shifts between ranges occur. Labels such as, “reliable," "not reliable," 
                    and "high risk,” are used corresponding to colors without an legend explaining the ranges. The absence of data predictions in-between 
                    the two ranges make it difficult to fully understand how reliability changes over time, a slide option could show this transition more 
                    clearly. Moreover, the chart does not clarify whether all winter sports need below-freezing temperatures since events might be held in 
                    climate-controlled venues. It also may be misleading to viewers if data after 2010 is used in the prediction models, as Olympic 
                    locations up to 2022 are listed even though the data range ends in 2010.
                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, this visualization shows the connection between environmental data and human community. By 
                    displaying the future environmental uncertainty of Winter Olympic locations, the issue changes from solely a climate one to a social 
                    and community one. The Olympics is a worldwide tradition that displays athletes from everywhere, so potential environmental shifts may 
                    impact this uniting tradition. Additionally, this impact may also occur due to the lack of reliable winter environments for these 
                    athletes to train. As more warm winters occur, less conditions may meet the requirement for various sports,  and all this may cause 
                    the number of young people exposed to winter sports to decrease, leading to less professional winter sport athletes. In summary, the 
                    visualization connects the spreading impact of this environmental change and the impact it may have on where Winter Olympics may need 
                    to be held in the future. It will be important to monitor to ensure specific sports can be included or whether adaptations to the 
                    Games may need to be included. <br><br>
